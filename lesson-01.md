# In the Beginning… Abraham?

<div v-click="1" class="w-2/3 mx-auto mt-12 text-lg">
  The story of Genesis begins with the Author’s great, great, great, great Grandpa—and how God began shaping a people through which His Son could one day step into our world.

  <li v-click="3"><em>The Covenant.</em></li>
  <li v-click="4"><em>The birth of Israel as the divine framework—an ancestral cradle—through which the Son of God would enter the world.</em></li>

# Let's Talk Ancestors

    The title slide mentions the "Author's great, great, great, great Grandpa." It's a fun way to think about how deep our own stories go.

      How far back can you go in your family? Can you name your great-grandparents? What about your great-great-grandparents? Does anyone know a story about an ancestor that far back?

# Where the Story Begins

What if Genesis doesn't start where you think it does? Everyone knows the Bible opens with the words “In the beginning…” But what if that’s not really where the story *you* belong to begins?

<div v-click>
The creation of the world is a prologue. The real action begins when God calls one man out of the noise of nations to begin shaping a family line through whom His Son would one day step into our world in real flesh & blood.
</div>

<div v-click class="mt-12">

  <p class="text-2xl text-center text-blue-400 mt-4">
    Genesis isn’t just about how the world started—it’s about how the plan to save you started.
  </p>

# God’s Call, Our Beginning

> “Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee: And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.”
>
> <footer>— Genesis 12:1–3 (KJV)</footer>

This is the moment everything changes. God didn’t start by giving rules. He started by giving a promise—to one man, for the sake of all.

<div class="mt-8 font-bold text-2xl text-sky-300">
The first step toward Jesus was a man stepping out in faith.

# Two Halves of One Book

So why did we call this lesson "…Abraham?" if the book starts with "In the beginning…"?
